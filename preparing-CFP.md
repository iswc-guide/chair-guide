# Introduction

The *General Chair* is responsible for organising the paper submission and review system.  The delais below relate specifically to [Easychair](https://easychair.org), which has traditioally been used; however, other systems exist that couold be considered.

## Time Line

### 12 months

Configure Easychair to ensure that the email aliases and submission forms are ready priro to the publication of the CFPs for each track.

## Preparing Easychair

The easychair licence is typically organised by the *General Chair*, with the invoice being managed by the *Local Chair*.  Aim for an Executive license for aprox 500 submissions (covering all tracks, but not workshop papers). This will cost in the order of EUR 2000-3000 (as of 2024). You can then ask last year’s General Chair for configuration.

In the superchair configuration, **there are settings for what track chairs can and cannot change**. It is a good idea to allow the track chairs to define their own settings, but the track chairs should coordinate actions to ensure consistency.  This could be done by the *General Chair* or delegated to the *Research Track Chairs* (advised).

As **some parts of the configuration are only defined by a superchair**, it is a good idea to give superchair access to the *Research Track Chairs*, to mitigate avalability and organisational issues etc.  Also, changes to the overall configuration may be requried at crunch times such as submission deadlines or the release of acceptance emails, which is overseen by these chairs.

Once the multi-track instance is up, the *General Chair* should **define the email aliases for the corresponding track chairs**.  This typically follows the format: [iswc20XX-research@easychair.org](mailto:iswc20XX-research@easychair.org). Consider setting up a *ghost track* with the email address [iswc20XX-contact@easychair.org](mailto:iswc20XX-contact@easychair.org) that includes the *General Chair*, *Local Chair* and any others that can help with general questions about the conference.

The submission forms **can only be edited by the superchairs**, so be sure to consult with the other track chairs prior to opening up for submissions.

One aspect that will require coordination is the review forms. The superchairs should **define a set of review questions at the conference level**, where for each track, they can then choose which questions to list, and in which order. As this will require significant coordination across all of the tracks, the superchair should share the respective form with the respective chairs, and to adapt it as necessary. Make good use of the previous year's review forms and modify only where necessary. Decision options (*ACCEPT*/*Accept*/…/*Reject*/*REJECT*, etc.) work the same (only configurable at the conference level), but the standard set of options should mostly be fine.  




## Preparing calls and submissions

* You will need to then coordinate all of the Track Chairs to propose submission, review, etc., dates, and make sure these interleave relatively well (for example, that P\&D submissions are a couple of weeks after Main Track notifications to perhaps capture some reject submissions or demos of accepted papers). Main tracks typically share the same dates, so you will need them to coordinate and agree.  
* Once the dates are set (needed to let the PC/SPC know what dates they are needed in the invite), push Track Chairs to invite PC relatively early, and try to get the PC published on the homepage relatively early (as this can help to encourage submissions). Be sure that the PC has a chance to edit/update their name, affiliation, and country.  
* Push Track Chairs to get the calls published as early as possible on the website, and get the Web/Publicity chairs to share on social media, etc.  
* You should also start to consider invites for keynote speakers while things are quiet. It is typical to try to balance industry/academia, core SW/related areas, as well as gender and geography. Typically their travel costs will be covered (economy flights, registration, hotel), though you may want to double-check this with the Local Chair(s). Push Panel chairs to also think about topics and panelists (whose costs are not typically covered). Note that SWSA expects you to run candidate speakers by them before inviting them.  
  * **TIP**: Of course, you might want to avoid inviting someone who has already given an ISWC keynote, or a recent ESWC keynote (as you wish). [This spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/169mThBN6U09JvH_cILnV5rih2WIJz3kClfV4kXJeick/edit?usp=sharing) might help. (And please extend it for future years.)  
* Around the time of the deadlines for the main tracks is a good time to think about ensuring that Sponsor Chairs are contacting sponsors, and getting agreements. First, they need to agree on Sponsor Levels (silver, gold, diamond, etc.) and the prices/perks associated. Then they need to start contacting companies based on emails/contacts shared from last year’s chairs.
