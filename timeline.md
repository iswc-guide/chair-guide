* Around the time of the deadlines for the main tracks is a good time to think about ensuring that Sponsor Chairs are contacting sponsors, and getting agreements. First, they need to agree on Sponsor Levels (silver, gold, diamond, etc.) and the prices/perks associated. Then they need to start contacting companies based on emails/contacts shared from last year’s chairs.
